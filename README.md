### Description

While roaming around down in the MSDN "Dungeons" for Office CommandBar info, I discovered that there are a bunch of built-in bitmaps for the Office Menu buttons. I've played with the dll resource bitmap files in the past so I thought that was what was being referred to. They made reference to a project that is available to view them. People with the Office 2k Developers CD can look it up. I don't have it so I improvised with this Add-in. Once I loaded up the bitmaps I got a bit of a surpise.... 3518 bitmaps in total, Quite a few more then I ever found in the compiled dll's and exe's. Some of them are blank so the actual total is less, but who's complaining. I added the option to save a bitmap to the add-in dir or pop it on the clipboard. I could have added more functionality such as dumping them all (should check for blank ones and skip them) and icon output but this was a quick diversion from other projects so.... Have at it.
